# Calculus 1 - Notes

This section collects the notes for the **Calculus 1** course, systematically covering the main concepts of mathematical analysis for computer science students. The topics covered include:

- **Functions:** domain, codomain, image, graph, injectivity, surjectivity, even, odd, periodic, and monotonic functions.
- **Sets and Limits:** bounded sets, maximum and minimum, upper and lower bounds (supremum and infimum), absolute value, and the triangle inequality.
- **Continuity and Fundamental Theorems:** continuity, Intermediate Value Theorem, Weierstrass Theorem, continuity of the inverse function.
- **Limits:** limits of functions and sequences, accumulation points, lateral limits, uniqueness of the limit, Squeeze Theorem (Carabinieri Theorem), limits of inverse and composite functions, infinitesimals, and infinities.
- **Differential Calculus:** derivative, right and left derivative, relationship between differentiability and continuity, tangent line, higher-order derivative, derivative of inverse and composite functions, monotonicity, local maximum and minimum points, Fermat's, Rolle's, and Lagrange's Theorems, second derivative, L'Hôpital's Rule (De L'Hôpital's Theorem), Taylor polynomials, convexity, angular points (corners) and cusps, qualitative graphing.
- **Integral Calculus:** Riemann integral, integrability of continuous functions, linearity and additivity of the integral, Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, integration by parts and by substitution, integrals of rational functions, improper integrals, comparison criteria and absolute integrability.
- **Sequences and Numerical Series:** limit of sequences, subsequences, Squeeze Theorem, divergent sequences, ratio and root tests, factorial, numerical series, and convergence criteria (comparison, ratio, root, Leibniz).
- **Functions of Several Variables:** domain, graph, level curves, limits and continuity, partial derivatives, differential and gradient, stationary points, second derivative, Hessian matrix, internal local maxima and minima and on bounded and closed domains.

These notes are intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental tools of mathematical analysis, useful for both academic study and applications in computer science and engineering.
